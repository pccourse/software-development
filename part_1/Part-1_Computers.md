# Part 1. Computers

Computers are machines, tools, to process information. Where writing and books are used to store information and the telephone is used to transmit information, computers just manipulate data.

Computers used to be people: it used to be a job title.

## War: what is it good for? (part of Part 1)
In time of war, it's important that information can be transmitted without the enemy intercepting the information. it used to be that couriers were sent to relay messages. Needless to say, this isn't ideal in situations where time is of the essence. That's why faster and more reliable means of communication are always being developed to use during wars. One of the latest and a very influential example of such technologies is the global Internet.

The problem with these new technologies, from radio transmission to internetworking using cables, is that interception of information becomes easier.

Preventing interception of a message is difficult. To reduce the risk of information being stolen, a good approach is to encipher the message; to code the message.

Information, data and referencing things
Information is data that can be interpreted. Data uses things to represent values. Those values can each represent, refer to, some other thing by itself and by combining values. Combining values is being done by structuring the values.

Data consists of structured values represented by things. Restructuring data may turn information into just data, not information. It may still be as meaningful as before, but it may be less meaningful to some.

If data is meaningful to only a few, or only one individual, and only to those or the individual we choose, our transmission of data will be secure.

## Information and instruction: to know and to do (part of Part 1)
The main function of information is to inform us. The main effect is informing us. Secondary to that, we may do something based on the information we receive. What we do is a side-effect of the main effect, which is to inform.

If our purpose is to inform to elicit a specific side-effect, and we expect that specific side-effect, we instruct.

## Computers imitate us (part of Part 1)
Computers are made to imitate us. We (even) talk about the computer as if it has a mind of its own. The inventor of the computer, Alan Turing, once and famously posed the question whether if a computer can trick a person into believing it is a human being, can it be said to be thinking? A test based on this question which he designed is now referred to as a Turing test.

The computer can do anything you tell it to do with information and data (today still, for example, it's being used to get to the information in apparently random data). It does this exclusively using very simple procedures, very simple operations. Turing first published an article wherein he showed that all data could be processed in all possible ways using just four operations and an infinite amount of memory, using such a computer. He called this machine, which is unlike any other maybe with the exception of the human brain, a universal machine. People now refer to such a machine as a Turing machine.

A machine, but also the language used to instruct the machine, is said to be Turing-complete if in principle, it can do anything (with data). In reality, a Turing machine can't (or at least doesn't) exist: since computers can't use an infinite amount of memory, it is limited in the data in can process. Also realise that to process data, it also has to remember the result of processing the data and any intermediate steps, the state of the machine, just like we need to remember the result of intermediate steps when doing mental arithmetic or when we reason, apply logic.

A modern computer is also a bit more complex. Besides using the four operations of the Turing machine, it can do arithmetic and some logic as its most basic operations as well.

## Value and state (part of Part 1)
If we value something, it brings us in a certain state. Since we value things differently, different things bring us in a different state. Those evaluations and the resulting states they bring us in, depend on previous states and previous values. We ascribe different values to things depending on the state we're in.

A (mental) state can be seen as a combination of values, but also a value itself (maybe a value one ascribes to oneself).

Machines can also be in different states. But like the mind, the number of states isn't fixed. There are a fixed number of different states memory can be in, but the machine can be made to ignore some parts in taking the next step. In different contexts, basing its decisions on different parts of memory, it can function differently.

When we apply logic to a problem (including mathematical problems), we use explicit (intermediate) states. When we use intuition, we (seem) to arrive at an end state without having to "mentally express" or explicitly combine values.

Underlyingly, however, we may express these emotional or subconcious states as changes in biochemistry and chemicals and electrical currents and conductance. All these represent the state of our brain, the information processing machine of our bodies (and mind).

## Form, function and values (part of Part 1)
A value is something without form. It can be represented, expressed, it results from valuation and interpretation, but it cannot be seen. It has a function, it causes an effect, but it isn't itself a function, a process.

Just like our brains, a universal machine, a computer, doesn't have to make explicit or interpretable, "mentally express" or think of, all different states it is in in order to function, basing a next state on previous states. But like our brains, different states and different values are still represented without us being aware of it, fully or at all.

This underlying representation is not very different from that of our brain: it uses (changes is) electrical currents and conductance. We don't really know how the brain uses biochemistry and electricity to represent mental states.

Luckily, some of us know exactly how computers do it. While brains may do it in the most efficient way, computers do it in the simplest and most exact and reliable of ways. This might explain why the energy used by computers far exceeds that of the brain.
Computers use electrical switches created by using electrical current to affect a material that is a semiconductor. Whether such a material conducts energy depends on (other) electrical currents applied to it. This is the only building block of that part of a computer that does the actual work. It's not very different from how the cells in the central nervous system (which includes the brain) (seem to) do the "actual work" of guiding our actions. Nervous cells just use other methods as well.
