# Course overview

Computers are increasingly being used to automate processes within organisations. Many types of jobs simple disappear.

In the meantime, the educational system in most, if not all, countries is too slow to adapt to these changes. Computer science university courses are still more like studying mathematics, very academic, and many skills that are actually needed in the workplace aren't being taught.

Many hours are spent by companies to make up for this lack of training.

Steve Jobs likened the PC (personal computer) to a bicycle for the mind: a natural evolution where the advances in the use of tools has allowed us to improve the workings of our minds. The computer isn't just like a printed book (another recent evolutionary breakthrough) a way to have an extended memory capacity, as it were, but to actually extend, simulate, some of the other mental capacities: logical thinking.

Knowing a way of interacting with the computer to exploit its full capacity, to have it do anything it can do (which is basically everything you may want to do with information), is a skill that every information worker should probably acquire in the (near) future.

All programming languages work very much in the same way. We will actually use only one language, but I will give examples in many other languages and I'll explain the differences between them.

## What are the aims of the course?

* To teach you what lead to the development/invention of the computer and what it can and cannot do and how it does it.

* To teach you how languages are formalised and how language can be used to instruct a computer what to do.

* To teach you which languages and tools are used to develop software, teach you to re-use software, test or validate it and to maintain it.

* To teach you to use software that others have developed and how you can find out how to use that software.

* To create two software applications you may use as part of a portfolio.

## How will I be assessed?

I will assess and comment on your work and I might ask you to redo some work. I won't be marking your work. In principle, you should redo work until it's at least adequate. I'll help you to get to that stage if you experience any problems.

## How many hours am I expected to spend on the course?

The course will probably take you about 290 hours. I can't promise I can help you finish the course one year from now, but I hope you'll manage to finish it in 6 months or less.

## What are the entry requirements?

All that is required to take the course is that you know how to use a browser.

I doesn't matter whether you do the work at a variable pace, but try to do it in a steady pace, as much as possible.

For each part of the course, you have to read at least one text and hand in assignments. An implicit assignment is to summarise, in your own words, what you think are the most important things you've read in each text. A few sentences is enough. More than a paragraph is too much. You may have to some exercises and you then hand in the source code you used/created.

At the beginning of each part (except the first time) you'll be asked to answer some questions about what you've learned from the previous part.
